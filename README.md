> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script requires you to either have the Steam version of [Sonic Adventure DX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/71250/Sonic_Adventure_DX/) or the Steam version of [Sonic Adventure 2.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/213610/Sonic_Adventure_2/) if you dont own or have one of these installed, please purchase or install it before using the script.

## Dependencies
Both scripts require these dependencies
```
zenity
protontricks
unzip
```

### Arch / EndeavourOS / CachyOS / Other Arch based distros
You can install all of the dependencies through the `extra` repo using `pacman`
```
sudo pacman -S zenity unzip protontricks
```

### Fedora / Fedora based Distros
You can install Protontricks, unzip zenity directly from `dnf`
```
sudo dnf install protontricks zenity unzip
```

### Other non-immutable Distros
To install Protontricks, [Please refer to this part of the Protontricks GitHub page](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks?tab=readme-ov-file#pipx) to install Protontricks via pipx. If you want to, you can install Protontricks via flathub and use the `setup-immutable` script instead

### SteamOS / Bazzite / other immutable Distros
Both SteamOS and Bazzite Already provide Zenity and unzip by default, so all you need to install is Protontricks. You can do so by installing it through [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks) with a software manager like KDE Discover or Bazaar, or by typing this into your terminal of choice
```
flatpak install flathub com.github.Matoking.protontricks
```

## Installation

### non-immutable Linux Distros
If you've installed Protontricks natively or through pip/pipx, clone the repo and use the `setup-linux.sh` script
```
git clone https://github.com/BNDays27/salms
cd salms
./setup-linux.sh
```

### SteamOS/Bazzite/other immutable Linux distros
If you've installed Protontricks through the Flatpak or are on SteamOS, clone the repo and use the `setup-immutable.sh` script
```
git clone https://github.com/BNDays27/salms
cd salms
./setup-immutable.sh
```
